Today I came to a conclusion that truly amazed me:
Deep Learning is not a separate branch from Machine Learning, but rather a smaller part within it.

Machine Learning (ML) requires many manually crafted features, such as color, shape, and other attributes.

Deep Learning (DL), on the other hand, does not require manually defined features. Instead, the model learns them automatically using neural networks (NN).
